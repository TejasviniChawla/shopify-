### UofTHacks 2026 - Amplitude Technical Challenge
Technical Challenge: Build Self-Improving Products with Amplitude - Behavioral
Data + AI
Challenge Description
Amplitude is the leading AI-first digital analytics platform, helping thousands of companies
build better products and digital experiences with behavioral data and AI. With powerful
Amplitude AI Agents embedded across the platform, teams can analyze, test, and optimize
user experiences faster than ever—turning raw events into an always-on “data → insights →
action” loop.
Your challenge is to build something that feels like a mini self-improving
1 product:
● Track product analytics-style event data (the actions users took in your app), and
● Use AI on top of that data to make the experience smarter, more personalized, or more
optimized.
You can apply this challenge to almost anything you want to build this weekend:
● A mobile or web app
● A game or learning tool
● A non-GUI interface
● A productivity, dev, or campus-life tool
As long as your project shows an Amplitude-style loop—from user behavioral events →
AI-powered insight or decision → change in the product experience—it qualifies.
You do not need a production Amplitude instance for this challenge. Storing events locally,
in-memory, etc. are all acceptable, as long as you:
1. Treat your data like behavioral product analytics (track events and properties, such as
sign_up_started, lesson_completed, page_viewed, plan_type, rage_click,
etc.), and
2. Show how AI uses that data to do something that a basic rules engine could not.
Example directions (inspired by how customers use Amplitude):
● AI-powered product assistant
Build a contextual in-product helper that “watches” user behavior events and uses AI
1 A “self-improving” product is one that:
● Continuously observes user behavior through events
● Uses AI to learn patterns and intent from that behavior
● Adapts the product, content, or experience over time
UofTHacks 2026 - Amplitude Technical Challenge
to answer questions, suggest the next best action, or trigger walkthroughs when a user
gets stuck—similar to how Amplitude AI Agents help teams understand what’s
happening and what to do next.
● Personalized journeys & recommendations
Use event streams to segment users (e.g., “new vs. power users”, “likely to churn”) and
apply AI to tailor content, difficulty, or UI flows in real time.
● Automated product insights
Treat AI like a junior data analyst: give it funnels, cohorts, or time-series data and have
it automatically surface trends, anomalies, or experiment ideas—like Amplitude’s
automated experiment variant generator for optimizing your product.
● Proactive retention / “save” systems
Detect behavioral signals like repeated errors, rage clicks, drop-offs, or stalled
progress, and use AI to decide when and how to intervene (smart nudges, help content,
or alternative flows).
● Feedback + behavior intelligence
Combine qualitative feedback (text, surveys, reviews) with behavioral data, then use AI
to summarize user pain points and propose concrete product changes—similar to how
AI Feedback turns unstructured feedback into product insights.
You can also draw inspiration from core areas of the Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform:
● Product Analytics / Marketing Analytics – understand the full user journey
● Session Replay & behavioral signals – connect “what happened” with “why”
● Guides and Surveys / Feature Experimentation – test and personalize experiences
● AI Agents, AI Feedback, AI Visibility, Amplitude MCP – examples of AI infused
directly into analytics and workflows
UofTHacks 2026 - Amplitude Technical Challenge
Judging Criteria
Projects will be evaluated on how well they combine behavioral analytics with AI in a way that
feels realistic for a modern digital product.
1. Use of Behavioral Data & Analytics (25%)
* Does your project define a clear event schema (e.g., key events, properties, and user
identifiers) that mirrors how real teams would instrument a product with Amplitude?
● Is it obvious how user behavior flows through your system (e.g., funnels, segments, or
cohorts)?
● Do you make good use of that data—rather than just logging it—for decisions or
personalization?
2. AI Application & Technical Depth (25%)
* Is AI doing something substantive with your data (clustering, recommendation,
summarization, anomaly detection, prediction, intelligent routing, etc.)?
● Is it clear how AI improves your experience beyond simple if/else rules?
○ Not AI (rules-based example): “If user fails 3 times, show a tooltip”
○ AI-powered example: “Summarize patterns or anomalies no one explicitly
coded for”
● Bonus: thoughtful prompt design, chaining multiple steps, or chaining multiple steps, or connecting to external
models/tools.
3. Product Impact & User Experience (25%)
* Would a real product, growth, or marketing team find this genuinely useful to ship on top of a
platform like Amplitude?
● Is the user experience understandable and compelling—even if the UI is simple?
● Does your project help users accomplish something better or faster (e.g., onboard
more smoothly, avoid churn, learn more effectively, find what they need)?
4. Innovation & “Amplitude Fit” (15%)
* Is the idea creative in how it fuses behavioral data and AI—something that feels aligned with
Amplitude’s vision of self-improving products?
● Does it show a fresh angle on using analytics + AI (rather than “just another chatbot”)?
● Does it reflect an understanding of the data → insights → action loop at the heart of
Amplitude?
UofTHacks 2026 - Amplitude Technical Challenge
○ e.g., “thinking in events, not page views”, “modeling user journeys over time”,
“using data to decide what to do next, not just report metrics”
5. Execution & Demo Quality (10%)
* Do you have a working prototype that clearly demonstrates:
* Users generating events →
* Events being processed/analyzed →
* AI driving a visible change or insight?
● Is the problem, your data model, and your AI approach explained clearly in your demo
and Devpost submission?
● Do you explicitly call out how your solution is inspired by or could integrate with the
Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform or Amplitude AI Agents (even if you’re using
mocks)
What to Cover in Your Submission
To help judges quickly understand your work, make sure your Devpost and demo explain:
● Problem & users
○ Who is this for, and what problem are you solving?
● Events & data model
○ What user events are you tracking (names + properties)?
○ How does this mirror a real analytics setup?
● AI behavior
○ What exactly is the AI doing with the data (e.g., “we cluster users by behavior
and then…”)?
● Impact on the experience
○ What becomes possible for users or teams because you combined behavioral
analytics + AI, rather than using either alone?
Build anything you want—as long as you treat Amplitude’s core idea: use product data plus AI
to build products and experiences your users will love.

## 2) Hackathon judging criteria (global)
Judging Criteria
Design
- Quality of UI/UX, aesthetics, and accessibility.
Completion
- Functionality and level of polish.
Theme Relevance
- Creativity and alignment with the theme.
Idea & Innovation
- Usefulness, innovation, and uniqueness.
Technicality
- Complexity of implementation, technical skills demonstrated, and quality of code.
Pitching Clarity
- Organization, and effectiveness of your presentation.

---

## 3) Project context and primary objective
- This website already exists in the folder:  
  **`/Users/tejasvinichawla/Downloads/oracle-merchant-landing-page`**
- The landing page of the above website will be used as a **pitch deck** (visual story).
- **Primary objective:** win the **Shopify prize**.
- **Secondary:** clearly qualify for **Amplitude** and **Foresters**, and clearly explain **Solana usage**.

---

## 4) Key constraint: Website and Extension can target DIFFERENT personas
- **Website persona:** keep as-is (do not pivot narrative to “small business”).
  - The website can remain “big customer / broad vision / premium product” oriented.
- **Extension persona:** make explicitly **small business oriented**.
  - This is preferred: we demo the extension as a small merchant tool while the landing page stays premium/big-vision.

This split is intentional:
- Website = storytelling, vision, sponsor expandable sections.
- Extension = practical “merchant superpower” UI that judges can immediately understand.

---

## 5) Hard requirements (must implement)

### 5.1 Keep the website UI/UX as-is
- Do not restructure the page.
- Do not redesign.
- Only add minimal elements that preserve the existing flow and aesthetic.

### 5.2 Add sponsor-track “expandables” to the website (accordion/collapsible)
- Add a section (or an unobtrusive insert) with expandable panels that can be opened during pitch.
- These expandables must be closed by default and not disrupt the visual narrative, and even while opened they should maintain the aesthetic of the websit

Expandables needed:
1) Shopify prize track alignment (primary)
2) Amplitude prize track alignment (event loop + AI)
3) Foresters multi-agent alignment
4) Solana usage explanation (must be crystal clear)

### 5.3 Align website + extension (conceptually, not persona-wise)
- Same product name and terminology.
- Same “market events → insight → action” mental model. (doesnt need to be actually implemented but the frontend should show something like that)
- But persona can differ:
  - Website can speak to larger orgs / broader market
  - Extension demo is small business focused

### 5.4 Solana clarity (currently unclear)
- Make Solana usage explicit in both:
  - website expandable
  - extension info/help UI
- Must be explainable in 15–30 seconds.

### 5.5 Extension: Small business oriented “Info” interactions for events
- The extension must include:
  - a small-business relevant set of hardcoded market events
  - an info icon or click-to-expand per event
  - “why it matters” + “what to do next” guidance

---

## 6) How we satisfy each big sponsor (implementation-oriented)

### 6.1 Shopify: “Hack Shopping with AI” (PRIMARY)
**What we need to demonstrate:**
- AI-powered merchant superpowers:
  - generate campaign suggestions tied to oracle trends
  - generate merchandising actions (e.g., “swap hero copy”, “bundle products”, “promotion timing”, “inventory suggestion”)
- Commerce intelligence:
  - world event → expected demand change → recommended action
- Strong demo:
  - small business merchant sees events, opens info, gets actionable plan, can “apply” suggestions (even mocked)

**Concrete extension features:**
- Panel: “Oracle Feed” (events) + “Suggested Actions”
- One-click “Apply” action:
  - can be mocked (writes local state + logs event)
  - bonus if it updates a visible “Applied Actions” list


6.2 and 6.3 can be done on the website only, no extension thing needed
### 6.2 Amplitude: Behavioral data → AI → product change
**We need a real event schema and a loop.**
- Track events for:
  - viewing events
  - clicking info
  - saving/applying an action
  - dismissing suggestions
  - time spent / scroll depth (optional)


**Visible self-improving change:**
- The extension adapts:
  - reorders suggestions based on behavior
  - changes default recommendation templates
  - changes explanation depth or tone

### 6.3 Foresters: Multi-agent orchestration (3+ agents)
**We must show:**
- 3+ specialized agents
- orchestration framework (LangGraph / AutoGen / CrewAI)
- explicit state passing + handoffs
- communication log


**Suggested agent lineup:**
1) Signal Analyst Agent — interprets event and extracts implications
2) Merchant Strategist Agent — translates into small business commerce actions
3) Feasibility/Risk Agent — checks constraints (budget, seasonality, brand fit)
4) (Optional) Copy/Creative Agent — produces final copy assets
